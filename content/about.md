Hi!

My name is Neel Chauhan and I am a Software Engineer at
[Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/) working on
[Workplace Analytics](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/partners/workplaceanalytics). I previously worked at
[CacheCash](https://ssl.engineering.nyu.edu/projects#cachecash) and
[NYU CUSP](https://cusp.nyu.edu/). I am a graduate of
[NYU Tandon](https://engineering.nyu.edu/) in Computer Science.

In my spare time, I like to hack on [FreeBSD](https://www.freebsd.org/)
[Ports](https://www.freebsd.org/ports/), being a Ports committer myself.
I am also a contributor to [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/).

To get in contact with me, my personal email is: neel **at** neelc **dot** org.

If you are contacting me about FreeBSD, use: nc **at** FreeBSD **dot** org.

I am also available on [GitHub](https://github.com/neelchauhan/),
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/_neelc/),
or [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/neelc-tor).
