# The Tor Project (2014-Present)

[Tor](https://www.torproject.org/index.html.en) is an volunteer-run Internet
anonymity service which routes traffic through three servers in an "onion"
design.

I am a [Core Tor](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/community/glossary#TorTornetworkCoreTor)
contributor. My focus in Tor development is on
[Onion Services](https://www.torproject.org/docs/onion-services.html.en) and
IPv6 support. I have also contributed to other areas in Tor including exit
policy configuration, entry guard optimizations, and FreeBSD support.

My Tor commits can be seen at
[Tor's GitWeb](https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor.git/log/?qt=author&q=Neel+Chauhan).

I also run Tor relays and exits, and have done so since 2014. My relays can be
seen at
[Tor Relay Status](https://metrics.torproject.org/rs.html#search/NeelTor%20contact:neelc).

# The FreeBSD Project (2014-Present)

[FreeBSD](https://www.freebsd.org/) is a general-purpose Unix-like operating
system derived from UC Berkeley's 4.4BSD. I have been a FreeBSD user since 2012
and contributor since 2014.

[FreeBSD Ports](https://www.freebsd.org/ports/) is
[FreeBSD's](https://www.freebsd.org/) package management system. This is
similar to other tools like Debian's `apt-get` and Node's `npm`.

I maintain Ports and a list is available at
[FreshPorts](https://www.freshports.org/search.php?stype=maintainer&method=exact&query=neel@neelc.org).

I am also a contributor to the FreeBSD kernel. I wrote patches for the
networking and firewall (IPFW) stack, to add support for Intel's Whiskey Lake
platform, and have tested other patches. Commits I worked on or helped
test can be seen at
[FreshBSD](https://freshbsd.org/search?q=Neel+Chauhan&project%5B%5D=freebsd&repository%5B%5D=src&sort=commit_date).

# Miscellaneous Personal Software Projects

I have also written toy software projects, all of which can be seen on
[GitHub](https://github.com/neelchauhan/).
