## The Tor Project (2016-Present)

[Tor](https://www.torproject.org/index.html.en) is an volunteer-run Internet
anonymity service which routes traffic through three servers in an "onion"
design.

I am a [Core Tor](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/community/glossary#TorTornetworkCoreTor)
contributor. My focus in Tor development is on
[Onion Services](https://www.torproject.org/docs/onion-services.html.en) and
IPv6 support. I have also contributed to other areas in Tor including exit
policy configuration, entry guard optimizations, and FreeBSD support.

My Tor commits can be seen at
[Tor's GitWeb](https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor.git/log/?qt=author&q=Neel+Chauhan).

I also run Tor relays and exits, and have done so since 2014. My relays can be
seen at
[Tor Relay Status](https://metrics.torproject.org/rs.html#search/NeelTor%20contact:neelc).

## The FreeBSD Project (2014-Present)

[FreeBSD](https://www.freebsd.org/) is a general-purpose Unix-like operating
system derived from UC Berkeley's 4.4BSD. I have been a FreeBSD user since 2012
and contributor since 2014 in various areas.

My current focus is the FreeBSD networking and firewall (IPFW) stack. I helped
make IPFW NAT aware of [RFC 6598](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6598) (Carrier
Grade NAT) subnets as well as optimize certain aspects of the networking stack.

Outside of the networking stack, I also helped add preliminary support for
Intel's Whiskey Lake platform, and tested patches for ACPI and certain Intel
Wi-Fi adapters.

Previously, I have also been a [FreeBSD Ports](https://www.freebsd.org/ports/)
maintainer from 2014 to 2020.

Commits I worked on or helped test can be seen at
[FreshBSD](https://freshbsd.org/search?q=Neel+Chauhan&project%5B%5D=freebsd&sort=commit_date).

## Miscellaneous Personal Software Projects

I have also written toy software projects, all of which can be seen on
[GitHub](https://github.com/neelchauhan/). Most, if not all are abandoned.
