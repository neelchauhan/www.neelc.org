# The Tor Project (2014-Present)

[Tor](https://www.torproject.org/index.html.en) is an volunteer-run Internet
anonymity service which routes traffic through three servers in an "onion"
design.

I am a [Core Tor](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/community/glossary#TorTornetworkCoreTor)
contributor. My focus in Tor development is on
[Onion Services](https://www.torproject.org/docs/onion-services.html.en) and
IPv6 support. I have also contributed to other areas in Tor including exit
policy configuration, entry guard optimizations, and FreeBSD support.

My Tor commits can be seen at
[Tor's GitWeb](https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor.git/log/?qt=author&q=Neel+Chauhan).

I have briefly contributed to [Stem](https://stem.torproject.org/),
the Tor controller library in Python. I have since then refocused on Core Tor.
My Stem commits can be seen at
[Stem's GitWeb](https://gitweb.torproject.org/stem.git/log/?qt=author&q=Neel+Chauhan).

I also run Tor relays and exits, and have done so since 2014. My relays can be
seen at
[Tor Relay Status](https://metrics.torproject.org/rs.html#search/NeelTor%20contact:neelc).

# FreeBSD Ports (2014-Present)

[FreeBSD Ports](https://www.freebsd.org/ports/) is
[FreeBSD's](https://www.freebsd.org/) package management system. This is
similar to other tools like Debian's `apt-get` and Node's `npm`.

I maintain Ports for a variety of software titles including
[Keras](https://keras.io/), [Mongrel2](http://mongrel2.org/),
[CloudCompare](https://www.danielgm.net/cc/), and [I2P](https://geti2p.net/en/).

A full list of Ports I maintain is available at
[FreshPorts](https://www.freshports.org/search.php?stype=maintainer&method=exact&query=neel@neelc.org),
and my latest Ports updates can be seen at
[FreshBSD](http://freshbsd.org/search?q=Neel+Chauhan&project%5B%5D=freebsd&repository%5B%5D=ports&sort=commit_date).

# Miscellaneous Personal Software Projects

These are software projects I wrote at various points in time "for fun". They
include:

 * [scrollify](https://github.com/neelchauhan/scrollify) - Tool to scroll up
   or down using the command line
 * [OnionLauncher](https://github.com/neelchauhan/onionlauncher) - Python/Qt5
   Launcher for Tor
 * [TorNova](https://github.com/neelchauhan/TorNova) - Python/GTK+3 Launcher
   for Tor
 * [currtime](https://github.com/neelchauhan/currtime) - Command-line real time
   clock for Unix-like systems

Keep in mind that most (if not all) of these are unmaintained.
