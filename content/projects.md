# Current

## Fourplex (2025-Present)

[Fourplex](https://www.fourplex.net) is my new startup building an affordable
solution to hosting servers behind Carrier Grade NAT and other firewalls as
well as IPv6 tunneling.

At the time of writing (2/2/2025) Fourplex is pre-launch as I am awaiting ARIN
IPv6 and leased IPv4 space.

## Fedora (2024-Present)

If it wasn't already obvious, [Fedora](https://fedoraproject.org/) is Red Hat's
cutting edge development Linux distribution.

I primarily package RPM packages for Fedora. Unfortunately Fedora does not make
it easy to sort packages by contributor so I can't share a link.

## Rocky Linux (2024-Present)

Built by the founder of CentOS, [Rocky Linux](https://rockylinux.org/) is a
100% bug-for-bug Red Hat Enterprise Linux-compatible operating system.

In Rocky Linux, I primarily work on documentation. My commits can be seen
[on GitHub](https://github.com/rocky-linux/documentation/commits?author=neelchauhan).

## The Tor Project (2016-Present)

[Tor](https://www.torproject.org/index.html.en) is an volunteer-run Internet
anonymity service which routes traffic through three servers in an "onion"
design.

In the past, I was a major
[Core Tor](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/community/glossary#TorTornetworkCoreTor)
contributor, focusing on
[Onion Services](https://www.torproject.org/docs/onion-services.html.en) and
IPv6 support. I have also contributed to other areas in Tor including exit
policy configuration, entry guard optimizations, and FreeBSD support. I still
post the occasional patch but I'm largely moving towards networking as opposed
to software engineering.

My Tor commits can be seen at
[Tor's GitWeb](https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor.git/log/?qt=author&q=Neel+Chauhan) and
[GitLab](https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/arti/-/commits/main?author=Neel%20Chauhan).

I also run Tor relays and exits, and have done so since 2014. My relays can be
seen at
[Tor Relay Status](https://metrics.torproject.org/rs.html#search/NeelTor%20contact:neelc).

## The FreeBSD Project (2014-Present)

[FreeBSD](https://www.freebsd.org/) is a general-purpose Unix-like operating
system.

I am a [FreeBSD Ports](https://www.freebsd.org/ports) committer, from being a
contributor from 2014 back in my senior year of high school.

I maintain many Ports, most notably [GNOME](https://www.gnome.org/) packages.

Outside of Ports, I worked on the FreeBSD networking, firewall, and routing
stack. One key set of patches was that I helped make IPFW's NAT implementation
aware of [RFC 6598](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6598) (Carrier Grade NAT)
subnets.

I also helped add support for Intel's Whiskey Lake (8th Gen) and Tiger Lake
(11th Gen), both used in multiple generations of high-end PC laptops like the
HP Spectre x360.

Commits I was involved in can be seen at:

 * [FreshBSD since 2021](https://freshbsd.org/search?project[]=freebsd&q=nc&sort=commit_date)

 * [FreshBSD pre-2021](https://freshbsd.org/search?q=Neel+Chauhan&project%5B%5D=freebsd&sort=commit_date)

# Previous

## Qeru (2022-2024)

[Qeru](https://qeru.net/) was a Virtual Private Server host focused on
affordable, denial-of-service-protected virtual private servers. I built and
maintained most of Qeru's infrastructure in a Dallas datacenter.

Qeru was sold to George's Datacenter (now [Energized Web Hosting](https://www.energizedit.com/)).

## NYU Tandon Projects

Keep in mind that I am no longer involved with these projects as I have
graduated NYU.

 * ["Docker for Education"](https://github.com/gcallah/docker-for-ed/commits?author=neelchauhan) (not affiliated with Docker, Inc)

## Miscellaneous Personal Software Projects

I have also written toy software projects, all of which can be seen on
[GitHub](https://github.com/neelchauhan/). Most, if not all are abandoned.
