## The Tor Project (2016-Present)

[Tor](https://www.torproject.org/index.html.en) is an volunteer-run Internet
anonymity service which routes traffic through three servers in an "onion"
design.

In the past, I was a major
[Core Tor](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/community/glossary#TorTornetworkCoreTor)
contributor, focusing on
[Onion Services](https://www.torproject.org/docs/onion-services.html.en) and
IPv6 support. I have also contributed to other areas in Tor including exit
policy configuration, entry guard optimizations, and FreeBSD support.

My Tor commits can be seen at
[Tor's GitWeb](https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor.git/log/?qt=author&q=Neel+Chauhan) and
[GitLab](https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/arti/-/commits/main?author=Neel%20Chauhan).

More recently, I focused on documentation, which can be seen
[here](https://gitlab.torproject.org/users/neel/activity).

I also run Tor relays and exits, and have done so since 2014. My relays can be seen at
[Tor Relay Status](https://metrics.torproject.org/rs.html#search/NeelTor%20contact:neelc).
I am a top Tor exit relay operator, with 2.5-5% of total exit capacity.

## The FreeBSD Project (2014-2023)

[FreeBSD](https://www.freebsd.org/) is a general-purpose Unix-like operating
system. I was a FreeBSD user from 2012-2022 and contributor from 2014-2023 in
various areas.

I was a [FreeBSD Ports](https://www.freebsd.org/ports) committer, from being a
contributor from 2014 back in my senior year of high school.

I formerly maintained many Ports including big-name titles such as
[Keras](https://keras.io/). I was also a contributor to FreeBSD's
[GNOME](https://www.gnome.org/) packages.

Outside of Ports, I worked on the FreeBSD networking, firewall, and routing
stack. One key set of patches was that I helped make IPFW's NAT implementation
aware of [RFC 6598](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6598) (Carrier Grade NAT)
subnets.

I also helped add support for Intel's Whiskey Lake (8th Gen) and Tiger Lake
(11th Gen), both used in multiple generations of high-end PC laptops like the
HP Spectre x360.

Commits I was involved in can be seen at:

 * [FreshBSD since 2021](https://freshbsd.org/search?project[]=freebsd&q=nc&sort=commit_date)

 * [FreshBSD pre-2021](https://freshbsd.org/search?q=Neel+Chauhan&project%5B%5D=freebsd&sort=commit_date)

## NYU Tandon Projects

Keep in mind that I am no longer involved with these projects as I have
graduated NYU.

## Miscellaneous Personal Software Projects

I have also written toy software projects, all of which can be seen on
[GitHub](https://github.com/neelchauhan/). Most, if not all are abandoned.
