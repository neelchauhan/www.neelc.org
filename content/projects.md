# Current

## The FreeBSD Project (2014-Present)

[FreeBSD](https://www.freebsd.org/) is a general-purpose Unix-like operating
system derived from UC Berkeley's 4.4BSD. I have been a FreeBSD user since 2012
and contributor since 2014 in various areas.

I am a [FreeBSD Ports](https://www.freebsd.org/ports) committer, having been a
contributor since 2014 back in my senior year of high school.

I maintain a variety of Ports, and have formerly maintained others including
big-name titles such as [Keras](https://keras.io/). I am also a contributor to
FreeBSD's [GNOME](https://www.gnome.org/) Ports, being a user of GNOME on
FreeBSD myself.

Outside of Ports, I'm an occasional kernel hacker, but it's not a big focus
anymore.

I briefly worked on the FreeBSD networking, firewall (IPFW), and routing stack.
One key patch was that I helped make IPFW's NAT implementation aware of
[RFC 6598](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6598) (Carrier Grade NAT) subnets.

I also helped add support for Intel's Whiskey Lake (8th Gen) and am currently
aiding developers with support for Intel's Tiger Lake (11th Gen), both used in
multiple generations of high-end PC laptops like the HP Spectre x360.

Commits I was involved in can be seen at
[FreshBSD](https://freshbsd.org/search?q=Neel+Chauhan&project%5B%5D=freebsd&sort=commit_date).

## The Tor Project (2016-Present)

[Tor](https://www.torproject.org/index.html.en) is an volunteer-run Internet
anonymity service which routes traffic through three servers in an "onion"
design.

I am a [Core Tor](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/community/glossary#TorTornetworkCoreTor)
contributor. My focus in Tor development is on
[Onion Services](https://www.torproject.org/docs/onion-services.html.en) and
IPv6 support. I have also contributed to other areas in Tor including exit
policy configuration, entry guard optimizations, and FreeBSD support.

My Tor commits can be seen at
[Tor's GitWeb](https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor.git/log/?qt=author&q=Neel+Chauhan).

I also run Tor relays and exits, and have done so since 2014. My relays can be
seen at
[Tor Relay Status](https://metrics.torproject.org/rs.html#search/NeelTor%20contact:neelc).

I was very active in Tor development during my college days. I have since
re-focused on FreeBSD post-graduation, but still put out an occasional Tor
patch here and there. I also still run relays.

## Miscellaneous Personal Software Projects

I have also written toy software projects, all of which can be seen on
[GitHub](https://github.com/neelchauhan/). Most, if not all are abandoned.
