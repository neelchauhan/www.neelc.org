If you haven't been living under a rock, many people who weren't fans of
Elon Musk buying Twitter seemed to be moving to Mastodon. Even I set up
[my own server](https://mastodon.neelc.org/@neel). Well, just to
[see a dip in users](https://www.pcmag.com/news/mastodons-active-users-are-declining).
I'd like to comment on this.

I do know that Mastodon is a Fediverse implementation, but for simplicity, I
will use the terms interchangeably.

While this doesn't mean the Fediverse is dead, it's far from dead. Yes, I
wanted the Fediverse to succeed, but as it exists today, it's a lot like the
Desktop Linux of social networks: a network for geeks and geeks only, and
possibly a subset of them. There are usability issues with Mastodon that I
won't describe here, but you can Google them.

Most of the developer and sysadmin types have Mastodon accounts, but non-tech
types, and even "tech people" whose main interest in tech is the latest iPhone
or Samsung aren't on the Fediverse, they're still using Twitter.

The truth is, the average person is an "idiot" when it comes to tech. Sure,
they may know how to use an iPhone very well, but when it comes to anything
that's non-intuitive, they stumble. And if Mastodon was originally built for
geeks, when non-geeks tried it they didn't figure it out.

While I'd love a decentralized internet, your mom and her children who aren't
CS majors or haven't been tinkering with tech since childhood prefer
centralized platforms. Why? It's easier for them not to have to select a server
and do the research. They just use what's in front of them that's "easy to use".

That's why AOL was so much bigger than EarthLink and mom-and-pop ISPs in the
90s. That's why everyone uses Gmail. That's why Desktop Linux hasn't destroyed
Windows and Mac. That's why the web is centralized.

And that's the reason why Mastodon and the Fediverse hasn't killed Twitter.
Mastodon is a social network for geeks as it exists today. Non-tech types stuck
with Twitter since we haven't fixed the usability barrier.

Non-geeks happily use Big Tech-owned social media, even if the said platform
uses Big Data, AI, and algorithms to keep you addicted, generating a
["permanent record"](https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/10/31/20940532/edward-snowden-facebook-nsa-whistleblower)
of everything you do at the expense of privacy,
[spreading misinformation](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/11/20/1039076/facebook-google-disinformation-clickbait/)
and even risking democracy to show you as many ads as possible, just
because that platform is "easy to use".

And in turn, us geeks can't obviously cut off our non-geek friends, so we
"settle" and use the same Big Tech-owned platforms as our non-geek friends.

I hate to say this, but as great as Mastodon is, the reason why Twitter remains
alive is exactly this: non-geek people find Twitter far easier to use. Even I
kept my Twitter account alive because of this, despite others closing Twitter
for good.
