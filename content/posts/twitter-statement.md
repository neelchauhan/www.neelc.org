If you are wondering why my Twitter/X account
[@\_neelc](https://twitter.com/_neelc) is blank, it's because of this reason:
X is basically KiwiFarms, but mainstream: a platform to spread hate.

I have gotten *politically conservative* ads despite following tons of LGBTQ+
accounts, having a trans brother, and being non-binary and aromantic myself.

Pre-Elon Musk, I used to look up to Twitter as a company. Now, Twitter is a
dumpster fire. The posts aren't even high quality, just "low effort" garbage.

The only reason why I won't nuke the account is because my
[DuckDNS](http://www.duckdns.org/) dynamic DNS login is tied to Twitter. That
only because Reddit login was nuked ages ago (well before the infamous API
changes).

In hindsight, I should've used GitHub, but nobody can predict the future. I
couldn't predict that a literal Nazi will buy an important social platform,
very less one I relied on heavily until last year.

As of now, I have deleted all my Tweets and replies. I don't advocate use of
Twitter and neither should you.

Nowadays, the most reliable way to follow me is on the Fediverse (a.k.a.
"Mastodon") at [@neel@neelc.org](https://mastodon.neelc.org/@neel). And yes,
I self-host "Mastodon" (technically [GoToSocial](https://gotosocial.org/))
alongside my email.

I will certainly miss non-tech accounts, especially those who couldn't figure
out Mastodon, very less run their own server like me. I guess there's TikTok,
not that TikTok is too great, but sadly now much better than Elon X.
