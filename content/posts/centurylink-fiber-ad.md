A month or so ago, I saw this ad in front of my Seattle apartment
(neighborhood: Capitol Hill):

![CenturyLink Ad in front of my building](/images/cl-ad.jpg)

My apartment is the building behind the green one holding the billboard.

Yet, CenturyLink only has 140 Mbps VDSL2 in my building. Neighbors only have
**15** Mbps ADSL2+ service. This is the result CenturyLink gave for my address:

I am aware it's nothing new that phone companies like CenturyLink aren't
upgrading their wires. But it's not right that CenturyLink is advertising
"fiber is here" in areas that don't have it. Either they should upgrade the
area to fiber, or not market fiber in ares that only have DSL.

By no means am I unhappy with my current ISP,
[Google Fiber Webpass](https://webpass.net/), although admittely I would take
CenturyLink if they had fiber in my building as opposed to VDSL2. I also would
take CenturyLink VDSL2 over Comcast any day.

But just because I am happy with my ISP does not excuse CenturyLink for
advertising fiber in areas without it. If CenturyLink wants to advertise fiber,
they should actually build it first and then advertise.

I have complained about CenturyLink's ads to Washington's Attorney General
and Utilities And Transportation Commission (basically a combined PUC/DMV).
I know my complaint may go nowhere, but hey, it's worth a shot.

While I'm no telecom lawyer (I'm a software engineer by trade), below, I have
collected a few facts about why phone companies haven't upgraded to fiber when
they were supposed to in the 1990s.

# Digging Deeper

But if you dig deeper, the predecessors to our modern phone companies who
refuse to upgrade their networks beyond copper DSL, the "phone companies"
(meaning AT&amp;T, Verizon, CenturyLink, Frontier, etc.) were supposed to
upgrade the copper telephone networks to fiber optics starting in the 90s.

For that promise, state PUCs and the FCC granted phone companies (legally known
as ILECs, or **Incumbent Local Exchange Carriers**) deregulation and price
increases for the supposed "fiber optic" future that never came. On top of
that, in 2001
[the FCC adopted a 75/25 accounting rule](http://irregulators.org/irregulators-big-win-we-freed-the-states-from-the-fcc/),
which let the ULECs put in expenses for their other lines of businesses as
local service expenses. This lets ILECs claim wired service is "unprofitable"
while giving a free ride to unregulated businesses like wireless, tech,
entertainment, et al, and on top of that getting more deregulation.

This is the reason why:

 * ILECs could wiggle out of the fiber optic commitments and get away with rotting DSL

 * AT&amp;T and Verizon can claim wireless is "more profitable"

 * Most Americans have a Cable monopoly for broadband, since only Comcast showed up

 * ILECs can get more and more deregulation while letting their wires rot. This means we don't have laws for quality of service, unbundling, etc.

 * ILECs get money for rural broadband and yet not deliver anything

 * Rural broadband is terrible

 * The US has higher prices for broadband and wireless than most of the developed world

 * The Ajit Pai FCC could claim Net Neutrality and other regulations "harms infrastructure investment" when it doesn't, but just becuase landline service is artifically unprofitable

 * An AT&amp;T customer was stuck with 3 Mbps DSL until he put a Wall Street Journal Ad, that we all know of by now

The telecom research group [Irregulators](http://irregulators.org/) is the
source of the facts I stated above, and I recommend visiting their site. They
have more detailed information on these issues.

To add, the Irregulators sued the FCC and the courts decided that states don't
have to follow the FCC's 75/25 rule when regulating ILECs
([source](http://irregulators.org/irregulators-big-win-we-freed-the-states-from-the-fcc/)).
This means the states are free to take on the cross subsidies and use the money
for building fiber and lowering prices.

In my complaints to Washington's AG and UTC, I have mentioned these facts and
linked to the Irregulators.

# What you should do

I recommend that if one of the following is true:

 * You have poor landline/DSL service

 * You have seen an ad from the phone company advertising fiber in areas without it

 * An ILEC claims to service you when they can't (copper or fiber)

 * The phone company doesn't provide any service to your address (as was the case in my previous Redmond, WA apartment)

Complain to your state's attorney general and PUC that the phone company about
what you experienced, mention the Irregulators data I showed in the complaint,
and state that states have the authority to fix the issues with broadband.

Also, share this article with others, let's get the word out.
