In my homelab, there has been a lot of heat output from my home servers. I run
two Minisforum MS-01s running Rocky Linux 9 both with Marvell AQC107 NICs, due
to a bug with the onboard X710 NICs.

I remember the copper 10G NICs generate a lot of heat when the onboard 2.5G
NICs don't, so I decided to order new NICs and SFP+ DACs off Amazon.

Little to my surprise that Amazon decided to offer me two-day shipping instead
of the one-day shipping when I specify a quantity of two.

![Delayed shipping, bah!](/images/amazon_shit_1.png)

*Delayed shipping, bah!*

I didn't want to wait two days, so I thought I'll do two orders: one for
tomorrow and one for day after.

Little did I realize that after placing the first order, the TRENDnet NIC now
gave me one-day shipping with a second order:

![Now I get one-day shippping, why?](/images/amazon_shit_2.png)

*Now I get one-day shipping, why?*

We all know tech companies are enshittifying. I'm probably assuming Amazon
is deliberately using two-day shipping here to *save costs* because we're using
Amazon for everything anyways.

I usually prefer to avoid Amazon for electronics unless I need an oddball
component which isn't sold by mainstream brands, or if Amazon shipping is
faster. And B&amp;H didn't stock the NICs so I had to support Evil Bezos.

I'm just glad I don't work at Big Tech anymore. In fact, you can't pay me
anything to go back, not even a $100M AI engineer salary.
