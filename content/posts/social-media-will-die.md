If you haven't been under a rock, we've all heard about Reddit's API changes
resulting in blackouts. We've also heard Elon Musk taking over Twitter and
in the usual private equity fashion, wreck it.

If you've been on the internet for a while, we've all seen social media
platforms die: MySpace, Digg, Tumblr, Google+ had a shelf life of a couple
of years, and then all either died, or didn't but faded from mainstream
consciousness.

Sure, some of today's platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit have lasted
longer, but none are free from making bad decisions that kill their platforms.

I have a theory: all social media platforms will die, and get replaced by
something better, and that new platforms will also die and get replaced, and
the cycle repeats. Look at Digg: their Digg v4 wrecked Digg, and resulted in
people going to Reddit. Then Reddit alienated users and people may move to
some shinier newer platform later on.

This usually happens when sites get greedy and want to extract revenue. In
Twitter's case, it was the classical private equity problem of massive debt
and needing to pay it back. In Reddit's case, it's a hope of an IPO and a
"profitable" company. Regardless of what happens, both could ultimately kill
their sites.

Yes, TikTok may be popular today, but I feel even they aren't above a demise.
Assuming TikTok doesn't get banned, they could make terrible business decisions
that wreck the site, alienate users, and die.

TikTok may also be slightly different in the sense that TikTok is more of an
entertainment app, not unlike YouTube, Netflix, or even cable TV. YouTube has
been resillent for many years, seeing MySpace and Tumblr decline but not them.
But then YouTube is not *really* a social platform, it just has some "social"
features.

But even if YouTube and TikTok fall under the "entertainment" umbrella, we
can't say the same for Facebook, Twitter, or Reddit. Sure, you can spend time
on Facebook or Reddit if you're bored, but social communication is largely the
focus of those apps, versus being just a "feature" of YouTube or TikTok when
the focus is video.

I have a TikTok account but don't interact with anyone; I just consume content.
This is like YouTube where I just consume content too. Whereas on Twitter,
Reddit, Discord, and Mastodon, I *do* interact with people, comment and reply,
et al.

Going back, the shiny new platforms today are the ActivityPub-based platforms,
like Mastodon and Lemmy. The internet has been screwed over by corporate
platforms. Maybe ActivityPub isn't ready for mainstream use, but maybe they
also will become mainstream. Or worst case scenario they're the Desktop Linux
of social media: a platform for tech savvy geeks and nerds but not your mom.
Or we may just rebuild centralized platforms on top of ActivityPub ðŸ˜­.

I don't know how ActivityPub-based platforms will fare, maybe they'll become
another Usenet (which is now mostly piracy). Or maybe they will become another
Email, which stayed resilient, but we've also seen email centralize around
Google and Microsoft.
